<p>Iâ€™m currently banging my head against a combinatory categorial grammar model for Ancient Greek, which will help us generate word order for Greek compositionally with minimal incidental structure. My more ambitious goal is to demonstrate a clear distinction between lexically mandated <strong>intrinsic structure</strong>, and the <strong>incidental structure</strong> which arises from an inexpressive theory.</p>
