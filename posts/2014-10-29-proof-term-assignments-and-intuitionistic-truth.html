<section class="post">
<article><p>In 1994, Per Martin-Löf wrote <a href="https://github.com/michaelt/martin-lof/blob/master/pdfs/Martin-Lof-Analytic-and-Synthetic-Judgements-in-Type-Theory.pdf">Analytic and Synthetic Judgement in Type Theory</a>, in which he convincingly showed that undecidability phenomena should be understood in terms of synthetic judgement, and demonstrated how the judgements of one theory may be made the propositions of another.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>To be more precise, he considers a theory with conjunction and implication, and a single judgement:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[P\ \text{true}\quad(A_1\ \text{true},A_2\ \text{true},\dots,A_{n-1}\ \text{true},A_n\ \text{true})\]</span></p>
<p>And the meaning of this judgement is “<span class="math">\(P\)</span> is true under the assumptions <span class="math">\(A_1\)</span> through <span class="math">\(A_n\)</span>”.</p>
<p>This judgement is then given truth conditions across the propositions by the usual inference rules, a few of which look like this:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{gather*}
\dfrac{
  Q\ \text{true}\quad (P\ \text{true})
}{
  P\supset Q\ \text{true}
}\supset\text{I}\\
%
\dfrac{
  P\ \text{true}\quad Q\ \text{true}
}{
  P\mathop{\&amp;}Q\ \text{true}
}\&amp;\text{I}
\end{gather*}\]</span></p>
<p>Now then, for any <span class="math">\(A,B\)</span> we can prove the proposition <span class="math">\(A\supset(B\supset A\mathop{\&amp;}B)\)</span> in terms of these inference rules as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\dfrac{
  \dfrac{
    \dfrac{
      \dfrac{}{A\ \text{true}\quad(A\ \text{true}, B\ \text{true})}\text{hyp}_2
      \quad
      \dfrac{}{B\ \text{true}\quad(A\ \text{true}, B\ \text{true})}\text{hyp}_1
    }{
      A\mathop{\&amp;}B\ \text{true}\quad(A\ \text{true}, B\ \text{true})
    }\mathop{\&amp;}\text{I}
  }{
    B\supset A\mathop{\&amp;}B\ \text{true}\quad(A\ \text{true})
  }\supset\text{I}
}{
  A\supset(B\supset A\mathop{\&amp;}B)\ \text{true}
}\supset\text{I}
\]</span></p>
<p>But it’s important to note that the premises and conclusions which occur between the horizontal lines are not essential to the structure of the proof: these are book-keeping. The data of the proof is the minimum whence we could derive this tree. So we could just as well write the proof like this:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\supset\text{I}(A;B\supset A\mathop{\&amp;}B; x. \supset\text{I}(B;A\mathop{\&amp;}B;y. \&amp;\text{I}(A;B;x;y)))
\]</span></p>
<p>And in fact, we could even construct a proof theory around our logic with one form of judgement:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[M : P \quad(x_1:A_1,x_2:A_2,\dots,x_{n-1}:A_{n-1},x_n:A_n)\]</span></p>
<p>And the meaning of this judgement is “<span class="math">\(M\)</span> is a proof of <span class="math">\(P\)</span> under the assumption that <span class="math">\(x_1\)</span> through <span class="math">\(x_n\)</span> are proofs of <span class="math">\(A_1\)</span> through <span class="math">\(A_n\)</span> respectively”. Here we will have rules like the following:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{gather*}
\dfrac{M:B\quad (x:A)}{\supset\text{I}(A;B;x.M):A\supset B}\supset\text{I}
\end{gather*}\]</span></p>
<p>Now, note that we are calling this rule <span class="math">\(\supset\text{I}\)</span>, but that symbol is overloaded to denote a few things: it is the name of the implication introduction rule in the original logic, and it is part of the syntax of this proof term of assignment. In order to avoid confusing ourselves, we could rename the proof term <span class="math">\(\supset\text{I}(A;B;x.M)\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\lambda(A;B;x.M)\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\&amp;\text{I}(A;B;M;N)\)</span> to <span class="math">\(\mathsf{pair}(A;B;M;N)\)</span>. Then we’d have</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\begin{gather*}
\dfrac{M:B\quad (x:A)}{\lambda(A;B;x.M):A\supset B}\supset\text{I}\\
\dfrac{M:A\quad N:B}{\mathsf{pair}(A;B;M;N):A\mathop{\&amp;}B}\&amp;\text{I}
\end{gather*}\]</span></p>
<p>But now, this is starting to look sort of like a lambda calculus. It turns out that the proof theory of the logic is indeed a monomorphic theory of types: these annotated lambda terms are simply another notation for the proof trees, nothing more.</p>
<h3 id="two-notions-of-propositions-as-types">two notions of propositions-as-types</h3>
<p>This seems pretty straight-forward for many users of programming languages: but lost in the enthusiasm for the “Curry-Howard Correspondence” is the distinction between two very different notions of propositions-as-types: there is the <strong>syntactic</strong> correspondence, which we have observed above, and then the <strong>semantic</strong> correspondence, which is quite different.</p>
<h4 id="syntactic-propositions-as-types">syntactic propositions-as-types</h4>
<p>The syntactic correspondence really holds quite on the nose: the formal proofs/derivations for the logic really are precisely the terms of this monomorphic lambda calculus, and the <span class="math">\(M:A\)</span> judgement captures the idea that in a formal system, you should be able to <em>decide</em> when <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is a proof of <span class="math">\(A\)</span> simply by examining <span class="math">\(M\)</span>; this is to say, the judgement <span class="math">\(M:A\)</span> is analytic.</p>
<p>Now, on the other hand, in the conception of Brouwer, “proof” was not about a sequence of well-formed formulas in a formal system. The kind of proof the intuitionist is interested in is not an algebraic game, but rather the characterization of the computations which may realize the truth of a proposition. For instance, let us consider the proof term assignment to intuitionistic predicate logic with equality and a universe, which is essentially Martin-Löf’s Intensional Type Theory; then the following judgement is evidently true:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\lambda(\mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0}); \mathbf{0}; p.\mathsf{coerce}(\mathbb{1};\mathbb{0};p;\bullet)) : \mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0})\supset\mathbf{0}
\]</span></p>
<p>This is a formal proof, but not the kind of proof that interests an intuitionist.</p>
<h4 id="semantic-propositions-as-types">semantic propositions as types</h4>
<p>Now, the latter notion of proof is captured by Martin-Löf’s meaning explanations and their metamathematical counterpart, the realizability interpretation. And whilst we asserted the validity of formal proofs with the judgement <span class="math">\(M:A\)</span> we will use the judgement <span class="math">\(M\in A\)</span> to assert that <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is an element of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(M\)</span> <em>realizes</em>; another notation is <span class="math">\(M\Vdash A\)</span>.</p>
<p>The meaning of the judgement <span class="math">\(P\supset Q\
\text{true}\)</span> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you know the know that <span class="math">\(P\ \text{true}\)</span>, then you know that <span class="math">\(Q\ \text{true}\)</span>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, the meaning explanation for the judgement <span class="math">\(M\in A\supset B\)</span> is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span class="math">\(M\)</span> is (evaluates to a term) in the form <span class="math">\(\lambda(x. b(x))\)</span> where we know <span class="math">\(b(x) \in B\)</span> under the assumption <span class="math">\((x\in A).\)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the term assignment under the judgement <span class="math">\(M\in A\)</span> is polymorphic and unannotated, unlike the formal proofs which contain all the type information necessary with them in order for the judgement <span class="math">\(M:A\)</span> to be analytic. It turns out that <span class="math">\(M\in A\)</span> is a synthetic judgement (it does not suffice to examine <span class="math">\(M\)</span> and <span class="math">\(A\)</span> to determine whether <span class="math">\(M\in A\)</span> is known).</p>
<p>Now then, under the meaning explanations, we have a much simpler proof term that gets at the root of the computational content of this proposition:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[\lambda(x. \bullet) \in \mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0})\supset\mathbf{0}\]</span></p>
<p>How shall we verify that this judgement is evident? Well, let us put it into English:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(\lambda(x. \bullet)\)</span> is in the form <span class="math">\(\lambda(x.b(x))\)</span> where we know <span class="math">\(b(x)\in \mathbf{0}\)</span> under the assumption <span class="math">\((x\in\mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0}))\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In order to understand this, we must unpack the meaning of a judgement under assumption:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="math">\(\lambda(x. \bullet)\)</span> is in the form <span class="math">\(\lambda(x.b(x))\)</span> where we know <span class="math">\(b(x)\in \mathbf{0}\)</span> for any arbitrary element <span class="math">\(x\)</span> in the set <span class="math">\(\mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0})\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then the evidence of this judgement is established as follows: <span class="math">\(\lambda(x.\bullet)\)</span> is indeed of the form <span class="math">\(\lambda(x.b(x))\)</span> by substituting <span class="math">\(\bullet\)</span> for <span class="math">\(b(x)\)</span>; moreover, if we know that <span class="math">\(x\in\mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0})\)</span>, then we know that <span class="math">\(\mathbf{1}=\mathbf{0}\in\mathbb{U}\)</span>, and thence for any <span class="math">\(M\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(M\in\mathbf{1}\)</span>, then we also know <span class="math">\(M\in\mathbf{0}\)</span>; we know that <span class="math">\(\bullet\in\mathbf{1}\)</span>, and therefore we know <span class="math">\(\bullet\in\mathbf{0}\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="one-propositions-proof-is-another-proofs-derivation">One proposition’s proof is another proof’s derivation</h3>
<p>Now, the evidence I gave above for the judgement <span class="math">\(\lambda(x.\bullet)\in\mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0})\)</span> may look like informal reasoning, but it can also be characterized as a derivation in the theory. And if it can be characterized as a derivation, then we can have a proof term assignment for it:</p>
<p><span class="math">\[
\dfrac{
  E(x)::b(x)\in B\quad (x\in x::A)
}{
  \supset\text{I}(A;B;x.E(x)) :: \lambda(x.b(x)) \in A\supset B
}\supset\text{I}
\]</span></p>
<p>But if you squint at the above rule, it has essentially the same structure as the proof term assignment <span class="math">\(\lambda(A;B;x.b(x)) : A\supset B\)</span>, and so it seems like we are back where we started. It is clear, then, that the term <span class="math">\(\lambda(\mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0}); \mathbf{0}; p.\mathsf{coerce}(\mathbb{1};\mathbb{0};p;\bullet))\)</span> may be construed both as a formal proof that <span class="math">\(\mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0})\supset\mathbf{0}\ \text{true}\)</span>, and also as a <em>derivation</em> or evidence that <span class="math">\(\lambda(x.\bullet) \in \mathsf{Id}(\mathbb{U};\mathbf{1};\mathbf{0})\supset\mathbf{0}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="interlude-formal-proof-vs-proof-object">Interlude: formal proof vs proof object</h4>
<p>Crucially, in case it is not yet apparant, we are dealing with two different kinds of proof. The one is “formal proof” or “derivation”, which corresponds to evidence of a judgement; and the other is “proof object”, which corresponds to proof of a proposition.</p>
<p>Now, in theories that have a judgement like <span class="math">\(M\mathop\heartsuit A\)</span>, you can often construe the terms in the first position as “proof terms” and those in the second position as “propositions”. And indeed, in intensional theories like those of Coq or Agda, the judgement is <span class="math">\(M:A\)</span> and not <span class="math">\(M\in A\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(M\)</span> is construed as a proof of <span class="math">\(A\)</span>; and this is a reasonable characterization from the perspective of such theories.</p>
<p>But starting from a theory like Nuprl’s, it is clear that its meta-level sequent proofs are the things which correspond with the terms of Agda and Coq, whereas Nuprl’s actual proof terms which appear on the lefthand side of the <span class="math">\(M\in A\)</span> judgement have no parallel internally in Agda or Coq. As a result, one can consider the meta-level in Nuprl as analogous to the object-level in intensional theories, except that in addition to containing the same derivations, it also contains many more interesting and useful things, such as sequent-style rules, derived rules, tactics, etc. Not to mention the wealth of subtle propositions and types which may be defined once one has made peace with the idea of working at the meta-level, embedding the type theory in a rich logical framework.</p>
<p>Now, Coq has tactics as well, but this comes through bolting on a second theory of formal proof on top of what was already a theory of formal proof (the Coq term language). This redundant extra layer in an intensional theory is inevitable, since there is no means to access the true object language under the meaning explanations and the intuitionistic interpretation of logic, which is <em>not</em> the annotated proof term assignments of the predicate logic, but rather the untyped lambda calculus: a system of computation, and only computation.</p>
<h3 id="next-time">Next time</h3>
<p>I’d like to note that there are a number of ways to make theories of formal proof, like Agda and Coq, less arduous to work with. Bidirectional type checking and elaboration can help a lot, and go a long way in making the proof term assignment resemble at a surface-level the unannotated computational realizers of Martin-Löf’s polymorphic, extensional type theory.</p>
<p>Since this has already grown too lengthy, I shall continue next time with motivation for why someone would want to bother working at the meta-level in a theory with synthetic judgement, as you do in Nuprl, as opposed to working at the object-level of an analytic theory whose terms resemble derivations in the former, as you do in Agda.</p>
