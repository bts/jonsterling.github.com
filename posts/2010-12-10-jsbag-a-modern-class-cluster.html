<section class="post">
<article><p>I’ve long been frustrated by the complexity of the Class Cluster pattern, and feel that in most cases, it can be replaced with something cleaner and more flexible. <code>JSBag</code> is an example of a new collection class with mutable and immutable variants that is implemented with a pattern similar to the Class Cluster, but far less coupled. I do this using Traits.</p>
<p><em>A ‘bag’ is a multiset, or a set which can contain duplicate objects. <code>CoreFoundation</code> includes <code>CFBag</code>, which is the same concept; for reasons of simplicity, <code>JSBag</code> was implemented on top of <code>NSArray</code> instead of <code>CFBag</code>, but it certainly would be possible if better performance were desired.</em></p>

<h2 id="traits">Traits</h2>
<p>Really, they’re just protocols that have concrete implementations. The way this works is that when a <code>JSBag</code> object is created, the traits (such as mutability) that it needs to have are specified; there are default implementations of each of these traits included (the implementation is in the form of a class adopting the trait’s protocol), but these can be switched out for alternate implementations. You can even add your own traits.</p>
<p>The way this all works is that when the <code>JSBag</code> object receives a message, it looks through its enabled traits until it finds the one which declares a corresponding method; then, it will look through its traits-to-implementation-class map to find the class that implements that method. Then, it grabs the <code>IMP</code> from that class and applies it to <code>self</code> with whichever arguments are necessary.</p>
<p>Whereas in the traditional Class Cluster, the abstract superclass tends to spend a lot of time jiggering about how to delegate its unimplemented tasks, and the concrete subclasses tend to duplicate a lot of functionality among themselves, this system allows pluggable implementations for traits that can easily be turned on and off. So, the <code>JSMutableBag</code> subclass of <code>JSBag</code> actually only implements one method, which is to override the enabled traits to include <code>@protocol(JSMutableBag)</code>. Other similar subclasses of <code>JSBag</code> could be created which add support for more, user-defined traits.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h2>
<p>The idea of this is not to use alternate implementations that carry down abstract bits from a superclass: the idea is to compose functionality by registering implementations of traits, and then dispatching tasks dynamically to them. That means that a few benefits of the traditional Class Cluster are lost, namely the ability for implementations to have alternative instance-variable layouts.</p>
<p>In the end, I think that the performance gain from that sort of optimization is going to be minimal for most things (remember, <em>YAGNI</em>). So, I believe that in many cases, a trait-composition design like that shown in <code>JSBag</code> could be useful.</p>
<h2 id="design">Design</h2>
<p>You may note that I’ve avoided using specific types of collections in my interface, because in most cases, all that matters is that they can be iterated over. Hence, instead of taking parameters of type <code>NSArray*</code> or <code>NSSet*</code> for some things, I’ve generalized to <code>id &lt;NSFastEnumeration&gt;</code>. Since <code>JSBag</code> adopts <code>&lt;NSFastEnumeration&gt;</code>, that means that methods which take collections as parameters can also take <code>JSBag</code> objects. This is incredibly useful, as it makes having methods like <code>+bagWithArray:</code>, <code>+bagWithSet:</code>, <code>+bagWithBag:</code>, etc. actually redundant:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode ObjectiveC"><code class="sourceCode objectivec">+ (id)bagWithCollection:(id &lt;NSFastEnumeration&gt;)enumerable;</code></pre>
<p>will handle all of this for us. This made implementing <code>&lt;NSCopying&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;NSMutableCopying&gt;</code>, and several other key bits absolutely trivial:</p>
<table class="sourceCode ObjectiveC numberLines"><tr class="sourceCode"><td class="lineNumbers"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6
7
</pre></td><td class="sourceCode"><pre><code class="sourceCode objectivec">- (id)copyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone {
  <span class="kw">return</span> [[JSBag allocWithZone:zone] initWithCollection:<span class="kw">self</span>];
}

- (id)mutableCopyWithZone:(NSZone *)zone {
  <span class="kw">return</span> [[JSMutableBag allocWithZone:zone] initWithCollection:<span class="kw">self</span>];
}</code></pre></td></tr></table>
<p>Remember that messaging <code>JSMutableBag</code> vs. <code>JSBag</code> for in this case only changes the default enabled traits from <code>{&lt;JSBasicBag&gt;}</code> to <code>{&lt;JSBasicBag&gt;,&lt;JSMutableBag&gt;}</code>. That’s pretty cool.</p>
<h2 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h2>
<p>I believe that this trait-composition approach could be generalized to be usable in many contexts. As I improve it, and make it more flexible, I hope to find neat uses for it.
