<p>I lectured on Vinyl and its denotation in Type Theory at BayHac. The <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jonsterling/programming-in-vinyl-bayhac-2014">slides</a> are available, as well as a <a href="https://vimeo.com/95694918">screen recording</a>. Among other things, I presented my new idea for records as sheaves, and my setting of Vinyl-style records in the context of the existing Containers research.</p>
