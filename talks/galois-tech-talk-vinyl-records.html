<p>Records in Haskell are notoriously difficult to compose; many solutions have been proposed. Vinyl lies in the space of library-level approaches, and addresses polymorphism, extensibility, effects and strictness. I describe how Vinyl approaches record families over arbitrary key spaces using a Tarski universe construction, as well as a method for immersing each field of a record in a chosen effect modality. Also discussed are presheaves, sheaves and containers.</p>
