<p>Records in Haskell are notoriously difficult to compose; many solutions have been proposed. Vinyl lies in the space of library-level approaches, and addresses polymorphism, extensibility, effects and strictness. I describe how Vinyl approaches record families over arbitrary key spaces using a Tarski universe construction, as well as a method for immersing each field of a record in a chosen effect modality. Also discussed are presheaves, sheaves and containers. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jonsterling/galois-tech-talk-vinyl-records-in-haskell-and-type-theory">Slides</a> are available, as well as a <a href="https://vimeo.com/102785458">video</a>.
