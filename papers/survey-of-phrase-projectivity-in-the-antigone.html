<p>In this paper, I demonstrate how, and to what degree, phrase projectivity corresponds with register and meter in Sophoclesâ€™s <em>Antigone</em>, by developing a quantitative metric <span class="math">\(\wp\)</span> for projectivity and comparing it across lyrics, trimeters and anapaests using the data provided by the <a href="http://nlp.perseus.tufts.edu/syntax/treebank/greek.html">Perseus Ancient Greek Dependency Treebank</a>. In the appendices, the formal algorithm for the computations done herein is developed in Haskell. <a href="/pdfs/Antigone-Projectivity.pdf">Download PDF</a></p>
