        <p>Baldridge’s Multi-Modal extension of Steedman’s CCG attempts to account for variation in rule applicability entirely within the lexicon, by annotating slash types (function arrows) with modalities, which license different combining rules: <span class="math">\(\bullet\)</span> licenses only simple application, <span class="math">\(\diamond\)</span> simple application and harmonic composition/substitution, <span class="math">\(\times\)</span> simple application and permuting composition/substitution, and <span class="math">\(\star\)</span> licenses all rules. I demonstrate that further refinement is needed in order to have a grammar which suffices for the most basic hyperbata of Ancient Greek (and Latin).</p>

        <span class="date">September  2, 2013</span>
    </h3>
    
        <p>Within a type-theoretic grammar, we must eventually deal with the issue of argument-ordering in languages which have (relatively) free word order. One approach, considered unsatisfactory, is to provide multiple categorial types for a word, giving the different orders in which it may accept its arguments; this is embeddable within a minimal CCG calculus. Another is to make copious use of the type raising operator combined with composition to construct mountains of unsatisfied clauses: this is less than optimal, however, given that the type raising operator itself is problematic for reasons outside the scope of this short exposition. So today, I shall present two different modest extensions to CCG which address this issue, namely <em>something old</em> and <em>something new</em>.</p>

        <span class="date">December 27, 2012</span>
    </h3>
    
        <p>Today, I hope to introduce a more lightweight approach to immutable objects in Objective-C that sidesteps some of the problems with class clusters (such as hostility to subclassing) by making some trade-offs. The class cluster approach provides the following fronts of protection against illegal mutation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Mutation methods only occur in the interfaces for the mutable variants. This protects us when types are preserved.</li>
<li>Sending a mutation message to an immutable object results in an exception.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m going to argue that the first force of protection (that of types) is far more important than the second (that of runtime exceptions), and that if we are willing to give it up, we can have a vastly simpler notion of immutability and mutability. Finally, I’ll discuss ways we can recover runtime exceptions in the case of an unsafe cast, and finally how we can recover the functionality of <code>-mutableCopy</code> in a subclass-friendly fashion.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Haskell’s Prelude abounds with partial functions, like <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code>, <code>read</code>, etc. There have been some attempts to resolve this by replacing them with safe variants that return <code>Maybe a</code> rather than <code>a</code>. But what about when we can make static guarantees about data?</p>
<p>Because Haskell doesn’t have real <span class="math">\(\prod\)</span>-types, we can’t bring those invariants into our program specifications in the same way a dependently-typed language could. But with GHC 7.4’s new <code>-XDataKinds</code> extension, many data types are automatically promoted into the kind-level; this means that we can maintain a static-dynamic phase distinction at the same time as having data structures mirrored into the kind level. Combined with phantom-types, this is enough to start encoding interesting invariants into the type system. <strong>But, reusing statically verified code for dynamic values can be problematic.</strong></p>

<p>One sad consequence of protocols only being commonly used to encode delegation is that beginners frequently conflate protocols with delegation. Hence the proliferation of tutorials on how to “do delegates” in Objective-C; in fact, I had written one such tutorial a long time ago, and it became so popular that I deleted it, for it was feeding directly into this very conflation (which I deem damaging to learners).</p>
<p>In this article, I’ll be showing a more interesting use of protocols: typesafe collections.</p>

<p>The latest versions of the Clang compiler extend the Objective-C language with related return types, which allow a limited form of covariance to be expressed. Methods with certain names (<code>alloc</code>, <code>init</code>, etc.) are inferred to return an object of the instance type for the receiver; other methods can participate in this covariance by using the <code>instancetype</code> keyword for the return type annotation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Typically, this feature is used for convenience constructors which would previously have returned <code>id</code>. However, we can also use it to encode statically-typed collections without full-blown generics.<sup><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></p>

        <p>It’s easy to express pairs in the untyped lambda calculus; adding types makes it somewhat more complex to get a correct encoding. In this article, I explain how we can build a pair with typesafe accessors in a polymorphically typed lambda calculus with type operators (System <span class="math">\(F_\omega\)</span>), and demonstrate it in Haskell. This document is Literate Haskell: simply copy and paste it into an <code>.lhs</code> file, and you can feed it into GHCI.</p>

        <p>If you want an <code>NSSlider</code> to snap on certain intervals, your option out-of-the-box is to give it tick marks (using <code>-setNumberOfTickMarks:</code>), and then enforce that it can only be set to values coinciding with a tick mark (using <code>setAllowsTickMarkValuesOnly:</code>). This is great, if you only want to accept values at certain intervals; but it’s not very helpful if you simply want to <em>snap to</em> values at key points (like quarters, or thirds).</p>

        <p>I’ve long been frustrated by the complexity of the Class Cluster pattern, and feel that in most cases, it can be replaced with something cleaner and more flexible. <code>JSBag</code> is an example of a new collection class with mutable and immutable variants that is implemented with a pattern similar to the Class Cluster, but far less coupled. I do this using Traits.</p>
<p><em>A ‘bag’ is a multiset, or a set which can contain duplicate objects. <code>CoreFoundation</code> includes <code>CFBag</code>, which is the same concept; for reasons of simplicity, <code>JSBag</code> was implemented on top of <code>NSArray</code> instead of <code>CFBag</code>, but it certainly would be possible if better performance were desired.</em></p>
