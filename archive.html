    <span class="date">April 18, 2015</span>
  </h3>

  
    <p>There are two standard techniques for representing dependently typed calculi in the LF. The first is to re-use the LF contexts for the object contexts, which can lead to difficulties when the meaning of hypothetico-general judgement in the object language is stronger than in the LF; this is, for instance, the case in MLTT 1979, where non-trivial functionality obligations are incurred in the sequent judgement.</p>
<p>Another technique advanced by Crary is to represent contexts explicitly, and then define a sequent judgement over them; this can be used to resolve the problem described above (and several others), but it comes at the cost of verbosity, and introduces certain other difficulties for my purpose. In this paper, I demonstrate an alternative, higher-order encoding of telescopes which can be used to faithfully encode the functional sequent judgement for MLTT 1979. You may also view a parallel <a href="https://github.com/jonsterling/twelf-cmcp">Twelf development</a>.</p>

    <p>The intrinsic and extrinsic views on types are unified by considering two categories: one of <em>syntactic</em> types and terms, and another of <em>semantic</em> types and derivations, and then a forgetful functor from the latter to the former. Following Melliès and Zeilberger’s <a href="http://noamz.org/papers/funts.pdf">Functors are Type Refinement Systems</a>, we might attempt to provide a similar characterization for computational type theories with universes, but there are some wrinkles; I attempt to provide a partial resolution to these here.</p>

  </h3>

  
    <p>The key idea of Observational Type Theory<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> is to make the <em>propositional</em> equality coextensive with the equality which is validated under the standard semantics for Type Theory, which is the meaning explanations and their metamathematical counterpart, the realizability interpretation. Now, Extensional Type Theory is usually characterized in terms of typechecking (membership) being undecidable because the “true” equality is made to hold judgementally; but this is a deceptive characterization when applied to Computational Type Theory (Nuprl), since there are many types besides equality which may be given meaning explanations but which have an undecidable membership judgement.</p>

    <p>Whilst the judgements of type theory are preferred to be analytic, the practice of operating a proof assistant is inherently and unavoidably synthetic, and is always accompanied by some manner of refinement and tactics: and so the question is never whether to use tactics, but rather how much pain one intends to experience in the process of using them: this is inextricable from the activity of proving.</p>

    <p>Baldridge’s Multi-Modal extension of Steedman’s CCG attempts to account for variation in rule applicability entirely within the lexicon, by annotating slash types (function arrows) with modalities, which license different combining rules: <span class="math">\(\bullet\)</span> licenses only simple application, <span class="math">\(\diamond\)</span> simple application and harmonic composition/substitution, <span class="math">\(\times\)</span> simple application and permuting composition/substitution, and <span class="math">\(\star\)</span> licenses all rules.

    <p>Within a type-theoretic grammar, we must eventually deal with the issue of argument-ordering in languages which have (relatively) free word order. One approach, considered unsatisfactory, is to provide multiple categorial types for a word, giving the different orders in which it may accept its arguments; this is embeddable within a minimal CCG calculus. Another is to make copious use of the type raising operator combined with composition to construct mountains of unsatisfied clauses: this is less than optimal, however, given that the type raising operator itself is problematic for reasons outside the scope of this short exposition. So today, I shall present two different modest extensions to CCG which address this issue, namely <em>something old</em> and <em>something new</em>.</p>
